This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Project Overview

This project is based on a pixel-perfect Figma template. The design has been meticulously implemented to ensure responsiveness and visual accuracy. It is an e-commerce website built using modern web technologies, focusing on usability and performance.

## Key Features

Components and pages are developed based on the Figma template.

Fully responsive design for optimal viewing on all devices.

Includes an intuitive user flow for browsing, selecting, and purchasing products.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
